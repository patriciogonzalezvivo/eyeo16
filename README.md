DEC 2009

Note:
In December 2009, I was working as **clinical psychologist and expressive art therapist** and starting the complicated process of **making your own website**.

I was **teaching my self** flash, googling around, until I search for this [“processing XML”] 

--

![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
this links me to **Processing** documentation

--

![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
Took me a while to understand that people were doing **art with code**.
…I felt that I tap into a world of **misfits** like me.

Beside the fact that I always have been a nerd that like computers. **Buenos Aires**, is together with Paris and Upper West Side, is one of the last places on the world where people do (and like) **Psychoanalyst**.

So while everybody was on to this guy:

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/Sigmund_Freud_LIFE.jpg)
![](imgs/carl_gustav_jung.jpg ) <!-- {_class="fragment"} -->

Note:
I was on to this other guy.
… his archenemy. Carl Gustave Jung.

Like most **archenemies**, they use to be friends. Jung, was in fact his favorite disciple. Freud even name him his sucesor at the head of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

--

![](imgs/Psychoanalitic_Congress.jpg)

Note:
They end up disagreeing in lot of things, but particularly two of them: a) the nature of **libido** and b) the scope of **unconscious**. Freud, father of this ideas, thought the libido was purely sexual energy, and the unconscious made of personal memories.

For Jung, the libido was not only sexual, and the unconscious was way deeper. For him was a **collective ocean of shared psychological content**. Not just instincts but a whole set of psychological structures, he later call **archetypes**. 

--

![Arquetypes image]()

We can find archetypes by finding patterns and correlations in different mythologies, believe systems, novels, movies, etc. For Jung this are common psychological structures, that sue and share. [Something like an arcane human API.]

Jungian therapy practices is based on the use of symbolic and mythological knowledge to amplify emerging archetypes. Helping them to emerge to conciseness.

Though he also open the doors to the use of ritual and expressive languages as non-verbal framework to exploration and transformation of psychological content.

Note:
In the 70's groups like those Lygia Clark was running, incorporate rituals and sensorial stimulation to happenings... soon they were using it for healing.

Note:
Since then, different expressive languages like music, dance...

--

![](imgs/DSC05498.jpg)

Note:
sculpture and painting serve as a non verbal medium that facilitate this practice.

--

![](imgs/a0431.jpg)

Note:
Each different language have the ability to think and said things in different ways. 

--

![](imgs/movement.gif)
Note:
Movement for example, it fluctuates over time... was this ability to transform things.... you enter into an activity with an emotion and thought dance you can move it, transform it into something else....

--

![](imgs/IMG_4796.jpg)

Note:
Painting is more like a sedimental process... you bring something and you put it on paper... then you add more and more stuff... 

--

![](imgs/IMG_4900.jpg)

Note:
Or sculpture is about subtracting, moving and releasing until a recognizable shape appears.

--

![](imgs/openprocessing.png)

Note:
Back to that moment I **discovered processing**. I was there looking to all this hybrid artist using code as a language. Seen for the first time code and computers as an expressive language.
What unique possibilities this language unlocks for us?
What new things this medium allows us to say?

I felt I tap in a community that I want to be part of.
I send emails to all the artist could found. 
Only one reply

*Fundacion Telefonica* - **INTERACTIVOS** (2010)

Note:
Here we are in interactivos 2010. I made great friends there, like Tomas Rawski, Joaquin Aras, Javier Bilatz, then Jorge Crowe, Guido Corallo, Leo Solas and Cris Reinaga.

I think it was particularly great because was unexpected.

I found this old video in my history vimeo of those days.

2011

Note:
Everything was exciting and vibran. I was truly feeling that I was integrating more parts of my self.

Jung have a interesting concept call **synchronicity**.
Analyzing his on dreams (and then drawing them in what becomes the famous Red Book)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-00.jpg)

Note:
… he wrote a series recurring apocalyptic dreams he was having. 
Those dreams scare him to the point that he was concern of his own mental health. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-03.jpg)

Note:
Then he start hearing similar dreams by some of his patients.
He was conflicted with the fact that maybe he was some how influencing them.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-01.jpg)

Note:
Years later, When the first world war start, it was clear for him that actually everybody was have been feeling something coming... 
In the same way animals feels natural disasters before they happen...  There was something in there air that was pict subconsciously by him and his patient..

Because this events didn't directly respond to a cause and effect relation. He call them a-causal events. And he thought they could be explain because of the collective unconscious

.

In June 2011  (five years ago)...
without any notice....
and after 50 years of lying dormant a volcano at the south of Chile call Puyehue made eruption.

Everybody's life that months have been affected radically for that volcano hundreds of milles aways.

Everything felt fragile.

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/31940579" class='fit' width='100%' height='1000px' frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

Note:
Before the volcano arrive, I was working on a **interactive projecting mapping over a sandbox, simulating** the more precise I could **an entire ecosystem with kinect**.

I was inviting the user to interact with it, and by doing that the user bring destruction. Then he have to wait, It takes time to the life on the simulation to go back to homeostasis. 

Although, we can't blame human kind directly for the eruption of the volcano, I use the ashes. For me was a symbol of how little we know. How much less power, and lack control we have.

NOV 2011 - **Efecto Mariposa**

Note:
I had the chance to show this installation several times in South America. 
I saw people getting some pleasure of this illusion of control, even it was designed to get out of control, we really think we can control things... Like when we bang the tv in the side to fix it.

Note:
Although Efecto Mariposa is made in **openFrameworks**, all the computation power comes from the GPU using **shaders**. A shader or two for each one of the sphere I was simulating. The process of learning shaders was hard, because of the lack of documentation about it. I decide to give something back to the OF community by breaking this shaders into modules of an addon, then with I called `**ofFX**`.

--

That addon becomes very popular...
And thanks the fact that **Zack Liberman** was trying to use it... we meet and get to talk.

Ahh... the early 2010's... 

I wonder how much of our decade is about recreating with technology, the Jungian concept of collective unconscious. 

Bid data, machine learning, AI stuff.... all had this promise of bringing some light to the uncertainty of the daily life.
We think that technology will give us back some certainty. 

Illusion of control.

Mapzen was other teams beside the one I work on (the graphic one). We have a **data, search and routing teams**. 

They do powerful engines in the open that are usually expensive to develop. Companies makes them as an investment, which means close. Companies implement them over and over again, keeping the innovation close and lost.

Thanks to the work coming from the search and routing teams, is the first time this engines are develop in the open, and regular people get to see them and study how they work. We feel that this will help by rising the ceilings on the industry.

In the spirit of it, I start my own book for those that want to learn shaders... so they don't have to replicate from scratch the esoteric experience of teaching yourself shaders.

Note:
I call it The Book of Shaders... as a satiric reference to The Book of Shadows.
In it I start dealing with questions about. Where to start? What's the best way to learn or teach code? How a shader "hello world" example should look like? What are the minimum requirements terms of equipment, conceptual and technical?

--

![](imgs/TBoS-01.png)

Note:
So together with the writing and thinking metaphors to explain concept. I found my self developing tools around the book. An ecosystem of apps that allows student to live code... helps them understand by tweaking and changing. Also tools that help them store, share and show their work.

--

<iframe class='fit' width='100%' height='1000px' data-src='http://thebookofshaders.com/05'></iframe>

Note:
The live coding editor, was crucial. Let's people have a tangible experience of what they are doing.

Also the fact that can be embebed was very important. Reducing the distance between the reading of a concept and the trying of it in code. 

The helpers to tweak and change variables was very helpful to make abstract concept more tangible. For example a vec3 can be a color, a position or direction. This concept are interchangeable in the shader. Because shaders are basically mathematical functions and vectors have that plasticity.

I have a close relationship with this tools, not only because I made it, but also because I use a stand alone instance of it, in my regular bases.

I just so **thanksful** to them.
They had translate the book of shaders to Japanise, Korean, Spanish and French. The italian translation is on the way.

Also talking to them is bringing new voices. I have this feeling that **the project start having a life in it's own**.
