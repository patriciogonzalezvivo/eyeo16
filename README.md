Hello my name is Patricio Gonzalez Vivo.
It's an honor to be here. Big thanks to Dave, Jer, and Wes for inviting me to share my work today.
**video autoplay at 00:24; no sound**
I thought I'd start by showing my most embarrassing video on the internet, and getting it out of the way.

Note:
I'm a **developer currently based in NY working at mapzen** building a 3D Map engine and experimenting with maps & shaders.
But **7 year ago I was a psychologist and expressive art therapist in Buenos Aires**.
I'm going to **talk about the synchronicities that led me here**.

![](imgs/arteparasanarte.gif)

Note:
At the very end of 2009, I was an expressive art therapist in Buenos Aires building a website for my business. The site was "arte para sanarte", which is a worldplay meaning "art to heal". I built it in Flash, and thanks to The Wayback Machine, I recovered it here in GIF form : )
This is the second of a few embarrassing things I’m going to show you, but it’s appropriate because this talk is going to be something of a spiral.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
While I was building my website, I **needed to figure out how to work with XML files**...
...so I searched for “processing XML,” and in the first of many synchronicities, I ended up here...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
**zoom this slide**
… to a webpage that I’m sure is familiar to a lot of us :)

and it **took me a while to understand what was going on on this page...** 
that this was a **community of people making ART with CODE**. I felt like I’d tapped into a **world of misfits like me**, and I wanted to use these tools for expressive art therapy…

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![Art therapy in general](imgs/arttherapy-00.png)

Note:
…so let’s spiral back to art therapy for a minute.

The expressive art therapy approach flows between different artistic languages like music, painting, sculpture, and dance... to discover, amplify, and transform emotions and processes in the body. 

It feels like being in a state of play... but these non verbal languages allow you to dive very deep.

Each different language gives you the ability to express your interior landscape in a different way. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-03.png)

Note:
Sculpture is about letting shape emerge...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-04.png)

Note:
While painting is more like a sedimental process where meaning deposits in layers... one after another...

Note:
Or movement which lets you embody a feeling and transform it over time.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-01.png)

Note:
Expressive art therapy is usually done together with others. It is a very experiential, organic and intense process...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![mandala](imgs/arttherapy-05.png)

Note:
often we end up constructing a collective mandala... as a way to tie the individual experience to the group.

Note:
**zoom this slide**
Because I was already working with all of these expressive languages, when I discovered the Processing community, I was moved by the use of CODE as an expressive language.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/crissugrue.png)

Note:
**zoom to just the text**
I emailed all the artists I could find who were working in new media, asking them if they knew anyone working in Argentina...

And Chris Sugrue **spelling** emailed back, introducing me to Diego Alberti... 

I got in touch w Diego, and he suggested that I should apply to interactivos Telefónica. 

(At the time, Telefónica was the Eyebeam of Buenos Aires.)

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/interactivos.jpg)

Note:
I applied, and here we are in interactivos 2010. I made great friends there, like Tomas Rawski, Joaquin Aras, Javier Bilatz, then Jorge Crowe, Guido Corallo, Leo Solas and Cris Reinaga.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![calos](imgs/arttherapy-02.png)

Note:
At that time I was also working as an art therapist with a group of kids at the CALOS community center, and that really influenced the project I made at Interactivos...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![communitas](imgs/communitas.png)

Note:
...with the kids in mind, at Interactivos I worked on a collective drawing installation. I made a device to try to promote interaction between people instead of alienation.

**from that I learn that technology has too much gravity. Adults were interacting in polites ways, almost with fear to break it... While kids were to discharge all their energy and anxiety. This exploration led to efecto mariposa**

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/efectomariposa.png)

Note:
**Where I want to make a more sensitive installation... where techonolgy was a little more hided and the interdace were more natural. Using in that time, the new kinect, I did a realtime symulation of the different spheres of an ecosystem, programmed in such a way that invites the user to interact with it but by doind that the ecosystem suffers... It reacts badly if you interact with it in an aggressive way... Forcing the user to wait unitl the system enter in some sort of balance again. Forced a gentle experimentation with the system**

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/freud.jpg) <!-- {_class="fragment"} -->
![](imgs/jung.jpg ) <!-- {_class="fragment"} -->

Note:
…spiraling back to psychology

I mention I was a misfit
**Buenos Aires**, together with Paris and Upper West Side, is one of the last places on the world where people do (and like) **Psychoanalyst**.

So while everybody was on to this guy:
[FREUD]

I was on to this other guy.

[JUNG]
… his archenemy. Carl Gustave Jung.

Like most **archenemies**, they use to be friends. Jung, was in fact his favorite disciple. Freud even name him his sucesor at the head of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-00.jpg)

Note:
Like was fashionable at the begining of last century between pschiatrist. Jung had a dream diary, were he not only write but also made drawings of their dreams.
We was very interested in the mythological content of dreams, dispite what Freud thought about the unconsius content. Jung thoghuth that their content were deeper than personal memories... all personal uncouncoius goes deeper into a collective source of unconcius material... 

Material that conform commons mental structures... know as archetipes.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/archetypes.png)

Note:
This idea of a collective unconcious... also serve as an explanation for significan events that seams not be connected by simple cause and effect.
Like dreaming about an event before happening... or been whitness of something that seams the "world" is trying to speak with you.

We want to differenciate this concept from mere chance by using the word synchronicity.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
maybe some jung quotes?

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/10PRINT.png)

Note:
It's hard to say CHANCE or RANDOM with out pointing to the work of Casey Reas...
Casey in this book, and some of his talks, points to the complexity behind perfect computer random.

For example in GLSL Shaders, a parallel programing language designed to run in the graphic card, there is not a native function for random.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
<iframe data-src='graph.html' ></iframe>

Note:
So to get it is necesary to construct it from a sine wave.
Like this
[LIVE CODE: fract(sin(x)*1000000.)]
Note that is not very well distrubuted... 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
<iframe data-src='edit.html?log=160306213426&menu=false&multipleBuffers=false&theme=tomorrow-night-eighties&canvas_size=halfscreen&canvas_snapable=true'></iframe>

Note:
So if I want to use it for example in the emblematic 10 PRINT maze algorithm looks like this

If I would like to take this that looks like CHANCE, and push it closer to the concept of Jung's synchronicity... I could construct random from a more simbolic source... like the wind direction. 

Luckyly I have been working on a simple visualization of wind over time using Mapzen Map Engine... tangram.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#14131A" -->
<iframe data-src="http://tangrams.github.io/WeatherOverTime/"></iframe>

Note:
Here I collect the data from all this wether stations... by featching each day the last 24hs of where data from the NOAA serverce... to work efficiently with the WebGL context of our engine, the data of all the samples of all the stations is collected into an image.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](https://rawgit.com/tangrams/WeatherOverTime/gh-pages/data/data.png)

Note:
this image.
Each colum is an hour and the rows is a weather station.
Any way... we can re use this data about wind to construct simbolic chance.

![](imgs/redbook-02.png)

Note:
Back to the collective unconcious... Jung was noticing that he was having recurrent vivid nightmares.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-03.jpg)

Note:
To the point he was worried he was going pschisofrenic.

"I saw a terrible flood that covered all the northen and low-lying lands between the North Sea and the Alps. It reached from England up to Russia, and from the coast of the North Sea right up to theAlps. I saw yellow waves, swimming rubble and the death ofcountless thousands... Two weeks passed then the visions returned, still more violent than before and an inner voice spjoe: - Look at it, it is completely real, and it will come to pass. You cannot doubt this.- (Octover 1913)

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-01.png)

Note:
On July 31st, immediatly affter my lecture, I learned from the newspapers that war had broken out. Finally I understood. And when I disembarked in Holland on the next day, nobody was happier than I. Now I was sure that no schizoprenia was threatening me. I understood that my dreams and my visions came to me from the subsoil of the collective unconscius.(July 1914)"

[maybe not read all... is kind of terrible that he was happy his theory was wright]

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->

Note:
In June 2011  (five years ago)...

and after 50 years of lying dormant a volcano at the south of Chile call Puyehue made eruption.

Note:
Wind, emboding chance again... move the volcanic plume handreds of kilometers a way.

All the way to Buenos Aires, where I was living.
In their way bring destruction,

Note:
This happened while I was working in efecto mariposa.
I used ashes for the installation.

[community; interaction; learning how to build; learning the rules of the system? ]

Not only made the work more singnificative for those that experience it, motivates me on working on the algortihms that simulates the different layers of an ecossytem to make it more complex... and less linear... more temperametan and sensitive to the interactions.
Althought is made in openFrameworks, I had to learn how to code in GLSL shaders, in order to do the simulations in realtime.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->

**start zoomed out more - rotate to be classic jesus view**
This is a visualization of sea level rising that I'm working on in Mapzen,
Is constructed with our VectorTiles of OpenStreetMap data together with our new elevation raster tile.

Is possible to construct a terrain with world coverage and see what areas are afected by the sea level rising.

**mention lack of OSM data - add slide of jesus view then go back to the rio map**

**nyc flood map**

from here I’m going to stay technical for a while and talk about how I came to make this map, 
and that comes down to Mapzen and the priviledge I have of working there, 
not just because everything we do is totally in the open...

note:
but also I had the priviledge of working width a stellar line up of some of the best professionals in the feald, doing what I love the most... shaders.

So back to efecto mariposa... My first openSource contribution I think was ofxFX. 
Where I grab all this layers of simulations I was doing with shaders.

[live coding in the book; talk about interactivity]

So together with the crafting the didactic metaphors. I found my self developing tools around the book.

The embebed live coding editor, was crucial. Shorts the distance from the reading of a concept to the trying it on code.

Also the little helpers to tweak and change variables was very helpful to make abstract concept more tangible. For example a vec3 can be a color, a position or direction. This concept are interchangeable in the shader. Because shaders are basically mathematical functions and vectors have that plasticity.

I have a close relationship with this tools, not only because I made it, but also because I use a stand alone instance of it, in my regular bases.

Note:
[shaders -> simple instructions -> haiku -> individual pixels -> harmony]

I love shaders because the constrains and the simplicity.

- There are no libraries
- just mathematical functions
- There input is images... and the output is images...

Is just code from the perspective of the pixels... the individual elements that compose an image.

In lot of way they are similar to haikus.  all you have to do is describe in few sentences an image.

This forces me to think algorithms from the perspective of the pixels... the atoms... the minimal components.

Note:
Since I have been writing shaders for openFrame, also I found a challenge on producing with them armony.

Note:
**make this a mandala shader**
that simple instructions can create harmony from individual pixels, 
that an internet search 6 and a half years ago would lead me here:

Note:
**make these mandalas circular and move a touch faster**
that that move, plus some other synchronicities, would lead me here

and that working in public would lead me here today.

[BIG MAP OF all the people that helps me]

Note:
[something something] ask people to think about all the people and synchronicity that have helped them to be here; something something synchronicity vs random, openness, community, fragility
