Note:
I'm a developer currently based in NY working at Mapzen, helping to build a 3D Map engine and experimenting with maps & shaders.

But 7 years ago I was a psychologist and expressive art therapist in Buenos Aires.

I'm going to talk about the synchronicities that led me here.

![](imgs/arteparasanarte.gif)

Note:
At the very end of 2009, I was an expressive art therapist in Buenos Aires building a website for my business. The site was "arte para sanarte", which is a worldplay meaning "art to heal". I built it in Flash, and thanks to The Wayback Machine, I recovered it here in GIF form : )
This is the second of a few embarrassing things I’m going to show you, but it’s appropriate because this talk is going to be something of a spiral.

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
While I was building my website, I needed to figure out how to work with XML files...
...so I searched for “processing XML,” and in the first of many synchronicities, I ended up here...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
… to a webpage that I’m sure is familiar to a lot of us :)

and it took me a while to understand what was going on on this page... 
that this was a **community of people making ART with CODE**. I felt like I’d tapped into a world of misfits like me, and I wanted to use these tools for expressive art therapy…

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![Art therapy in general](imgs/arttherapy-00.png)

Note:
…so let’s spiral back to art therapy for a minute.

The expressive art therapy approach flows between different artistic languages like music, painting, sculpture, and dance... to discover, amplify, and transform emotions and processes in the body. 

It feels like being in a state of play... but these non verbal languages allow you to dive very deep.

Each different language gives you the ability to express your interior landscape in a different way. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-03.png)

Note:
Sculpture is about letting shape emerge...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-04.png)

Note:
While painting is more like a sedimental process where meaning deposits in layers... one after another...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/arttherapy-movement.gif)

Note:
And movement lets you embody a feeling and transform it over time.

![sculpture](imgs/arttherapy-01.png)

Note:
Expressive art therapy is usually done together with others. It is a very experiential, organic and intense process...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![mandala](imgs/arttherapy-05.png)

Note:
often we end up constructing a collective mandala... as a way to tie the individual experience to the group.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
Because I was already working with all of these expressive languages, when I discovered the Processing community, I was moved by the use of CODE as an expressive language.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#FFFFFF" -->
![](imgs/crissugrue.png)

Note:
I emailed all the artists I could find who were working in new media, asking them if they knew anyone working in Argentina...

And Chris Sugrue emailed back, introducing me to Diego Alberti... 

I got in touch w Diego, and he suggested that I should apply to interactivos Telefónica. 

(At the time, Telefónica was the Eyebeam of Buenos Aires.)

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/interactivos.jpg)

Note:
I applied, and here we are in interactivos 2010. I made great friends there, like Tomas Rawski, Joaquin Aras, Javier Bilatz, then Jorge Crowe, Guido Corallo, Leo Solas and Cris Reinaga.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![calos](imgs/arttherapy-02.png)

Note:
At that time I was also working as an art therapist with a group of kids at the CALOS community center, and that really influenced the project I made at Interactivos...

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![communitas](imgs/communitas.png)

Note:
...with the kids in mind, at Interactivos I worked on a collective drawing installation. I made a device to try to promote interaction between people instead of alienation.

But I found that the installation didn't get people to interact in the ways I'd imagined...

Adults were interacting in polite ways, almost afraid to break the table... 

While kids used it to discharge all their energy and anxiety. 

I felt that the technological feel of the installation had too much gravity - people interacted much differently with this technical collective mandala than they did when painting a collective mandala on paper.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/efectomariposa.png)

Note:
These reflections led me to make my next project, efecto mariposa (or "the butterfly effect")

I wanted to make a more sensitive installation, where techonology was hidden beneath a more natural interface.


--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->

Note:
The kinect was new back in those days, and I did a realtime simulation of the different spheres of an ecosystem,

Note:
**add slides of pics of people and hands playing with the system**

programmed in such a way that the ecosystem suffers if people interact with it in an aggressive way... **Then they had to wait until the system regained balance to interact with it again.** 

This forced a gentle experimentation with the system

![](imgs/jung.jpg ) <!-- {_class="fragment"} -->

Note:
Another synchronicity happened while I was making Efecto Mariposa, but to explain it, and to explain what I mean by synchronicity, I'm going to spiral back to psychology

I'm from Buenos Aires, which, together with Paris and the Upper East Side, is one of the last places in the world where people do Psychoanalysis.

Among Buenos Aires psychologists, everyone was into this guy:

FREUD.

But I was into this other guy.

… his archenemy. Carl Gustave Jung.

Like most archenemies, they use to be friends. Jung was Freud's favorite student. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-00.jpg)

Note:
At the begining of the 1900s it was fashionable for psychiatrists to keep dream diaries. Jung had a dream diary, where he drew his dreams.
Jung was very interested in the mythological content of dreams. Freud thought the unconsious content of dreams came from personal memories, but Jung thoghuth that the unconscious content came from a place deeper than personal memories... 

Jung believed that every person's unconscious goes deeper into a collective source of unconscious material... 

That collective source material makes our common mental structures... called Jungian archetypes.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
# slide that represents collective unconscious

Note:
**this needs a different visual, archetypes makes no sense**
This idea of a collective unconcious... also serve as an explanation for significan events that seams not be connected by simple cause and effect.
Like dreaming about an event before happening... or been whitness of something that seams the "world" is trying to speak with you.

We want to differenciate this concept from mere chance by using the word synchronicity.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-02.png)

Note:
Back to the collective unconcious... Jung was noticing that he was having recurrent vivid nightmares.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-03.jpg)

Note:
Nightmares about floods. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-01.png)

Note:
Nightmares about volcanoes. He worried that he was becoming schizophrenic. **He also noticed that many of his patients were having similar nightmares, and was worried that he was somehow "infecting" them with his own nightmares.**

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->

"On July 31st, immediatly affter my lecture, I learned from the newspapers 

that **war had broken out**. Finally I understood. And when I disembarked in 

Holland on the next day, **nobody was happier than I**. Now I was sure that 

no schizoprenia was threatening me. I understood that **my dreams and my** 

**visions came to me from the subsoil of the collective unconscius**." 

(July 1914)

Note:
**Jung... not really a great guy. But these collective nightmares he was noticing became his support for the idea of a collective unconscious, tapping into some future vision that war was coming.**

Note:
In June 2011  (five years ago)...

Note:
This eruption happened while I was working in efecto mariposa.
I used ashes for the installation.

Not only made the work more singnificative for those that experience it, motivates me on working on the algortihms that simulates the different layers of an ecossytem to make it more complex... and less linear... more temperametan and sensitive to the interactions. **influenced by the synchronicity of the volcano, both in the form of the installation, and in creating it's function, to react in unexpected ways.**

Althought is made in openFrameworks, I had to learn how to code in GLSL shaders, in order to do the simulations in realtime.

Note:
I absolutely fell in love with shaders. 

I love shaders because the constrains and the simplicity.

- There are no libraries
- just mathematical functions
- There input is images... and the output is images...

Is just code from the perspective of the pixels... the individual elements that compose an image.

In lot of way they are similar to haikus.  all you have to do is describe in few sentences an image.

This forces me to think algorithms from the perspective of the pixels... the atoms... the minimal components.

And I'm not there yet, but I think this simplicity can be an expressive language.

[live coding in the book; talk about interactivity]

So together with the crafting the didactic metaphors. I found my self developing tools around the book.

The embebed live coding editor, was crucial. Shorts the distance from the reading of a concept to the trying it on code.

Also the little helpers to tweak and change variables was very helpful to make abstract concept more tangible. For example a vec3 can be a color, a position or direction. This concept are interchangeable in the shader. Because shaders are basically mathematical functions and vectors have that plasticity.

I have a close relationship with this tools, not only because I made it, but also because I use a stand alone instance of it, in my regular bases. **this is weird**
