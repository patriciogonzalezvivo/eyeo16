DEC 2009

Note:
Dic 2009, starting the annoying/imposible process of making your own website. I was working as Clinical Psychologist and Expressive art Therapist in that time.
I was teaching my self flash to make my own website for my practice as an art therapist. Googling around I search for “processing XML”

--

![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
Which lead me to processing documentation (made by Scott Murray??)

--

![](imgs/openprocessing.png)

Note:
The discovery was FASCINATING. This people were combining arts with computer code.
In my world at that moment I was a misfit.

Beside the fact that I always have been a nerd that like computers. Buenos Aires, is together with Paris and Upper West Side in Manhattan, one of the last places where people do (and like) Psychoanalyst.

So while everybody in school was into this guy:

--

![](imgs/Sigmund_Freud_LIFE.jpg)

Note:
was a fan of this other guy.

--

![](imgs/carl_gustav_jung.jpg )

Note:
… his archenemy, Carl Gustave Jung.

(he actually looks like my grand father)

Like most archenemies, they use to be friends. Jung was the favorite disciple. Freud name him his sucesor and put him in charge of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

--

![](imgs/Psychoanalitic_Congress.jpg)

Note:
They disagree on the origin of libido and in the scope of unconscious. Freud, father of this ideas, thought the libido was just sexual, and the unconscious made of personal memories.

Jung disagree that the libido was only a sexual. He also believed that deeper than the personal unconscious was a bast collective ocean of shared psychological content. Not just instincts but a whole set of psychological structures, he later call archetypes. They manifest in mythological themes, images, patterns visible along generations and around the world.

Note:
For him the personal psique emerge from this collective sea

--

![](http://www.palgrave-journals.com/pcs/journal/v18/n4/images/pcs201318f1.jpg)

Note:
I was in love with this ideas, to the point that I did a post degree in Jung and the use of art as a way to pull content from this deep ocean. To amplify meaning thought the use of different expressive languages.

Is funny because each different language have the ability to think and said things in different ways. Movement for example, it fluctuates over time... was this ability to transform things.... you enter into an activity with an emotion and thought dance you can move it, transform it into something else....  Painting is more like a sedimental process... you bring something and you put it on paper... then you add more and more stuff... an image slowly appears over time. 

So I was there looking to all this hybrid artist using code as a language. I was intrigue  about what the uses of this as an expressive language. What could be said with technology that could be said in another way.

I send emails to all the artist could found.

Jung have a interesting concept call **synchronicity**
On his work he notice that In his diaries, what later become the red book….

Note:
… he wrote a series of apocalyptic dreams he had. He was concern of his own mental health. But then he start hearing similar dreams by some of his patients.  He was conflicted with the fact that maybe he was some how influencing them.

Note:
When the first world war start was clear for him that actually everybody was have been feeling something coming... In the same way animals feels natural disasters before they happen... There was something in there air that was pict subconsciously by him and his patient..

Because this events didn't directly respond to a cause and effect relation. He call them acausal events. And he thought they could be explain because  of the collective incouncius

In June 2011  (five years ago)...
without any notice....
and after 50 years of lying dormant a volcano at the south of Chille call Puyehue made eruption.

Note:
During the volcano I was working on a project that use kinect camera to do a projection mapping of a ecosystem simulation over a sandbox. My goal was to invite user to interact with it, and by that bring destruction that will take some time to heal and go back to homeostasis. The scale of the volcano eruption had a great influence in this peace. I replace the sand by volcanic ashes, and work hard on it to make the algorithms as complex and realistic as I could. For that I had to learn shaders. It wasn't easy, but at the end was very satisfying to see that the people interacting with it. I like to think that something of what we experience that year could be re experienced in this particular way. In order to think it in a different and healing way.

Open Source it into an OF addon: ofFX

![](imgs/book.png)

Note:
I want to tell a little more about a particular project I have been working, since I joing Mapzen and had some extra time for my own.

Learning shaders by my onw was hard back on the days of efecto mariposa, so I was wanting to help others start with GLSL Shaders.
Also a good way to give something back to the community that brodme here.

--

![](imgs/TBoS-00.png)

Note:
So I start writing this long time project

--

![](imgs/TBoS-01.png)

Note:
Together with the writing cames ideas to make it more didactic

**[o]** openFrame.io

Note:
Another project I got to collaborate totaly by chance is openFrame

--

![](imgs/openFrame-guys.png)

Note:
I run on the street with Ishac. And he toldme he toldme he was working in what in that moment understood as the openSource version of ElectricObjects but with RaspberryPi. I got excited because I have been using raspberrypies to visualize shaders. 

--

![](imgs/glslViewer.gif)

Note:
By that time I was working on this cross platforms shader viewer for live coding that also run in the RaspberryPi. So after he finish his explanation I took out my lapdoc with my raspberry pi and show the patterns inspired on Ryoji Ikeda, running in the RPi, and convince him to add it to the system.

OpenFrameworks is great because is just a node.js server running websocket that triggers console programs... so is crazy flexible.

Then I work on the online editor, to be hable to export and host shaders in order to be hable to send them to openFrames.

Any way... He told me that and I open the lapdoc for my RPI and show some shaders running... and said: we can show artwork in form of shaders!


I really like shaders. I like the size and their restrictions and power.
They are like a HAIKUs. You have no library to reference... and you just can generate images.

*LineOfSight*

Note:
For Line of Sight I have this problem of how to update the position of 1500 moving targets wit precession.

--

![](imgs/texture.png)

Note:
The solution was to encode all the future positions of each satellite in the next following hour into a image.
Each pixel is encode a big number with pressition enought to display it in the exact locating it will be.
The first part of the screen are for the longitudes while the second is latitud.
Each satelitte just need to read in the right row at the right offset on time to know their exact location.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#2E2A27" -->
![](imgs/roll.jpg)

Note:
Imagine that image as a "played piano roll". Each satellite, like a each key on the piano will read one line of the image. But instead of the binarry format of the roll... will look for a position incoded in color.
