DEC 2009

Note:
In dicember 2009, I was working on the annoying/imposible process of making your own website.
In my case this website

Note:
It's important to say in that time I was working as Clinical Psychologist and Expressive art Therapist.
Esentially doing a lot of things that looks this other thing:

--

![](imgs/DSCN0373.JPG)
<!-- ![](imgs/DSC05495.JPG) -->

Note:
Any way...
I was teaching my self flash to make my own website for my practice as an art therapist. 
Googling around I search for “processing XML”

--

![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
Which lead me to processing documentation (made by Scott Murray??)

--

![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
I was FASCINATED. 

This people were combining arts with computer code.
In my world at that moment I was a misfit.

Beside the fact that I always have been a nerd that like computers. Buenos Aires, is together with Paris and Upper West Side in Manhattan, one of the last places where people do (and like) Psychoanalyst.

So while everybody in school was into this guy:

--

![](imgs/Sigmund_Freud_LIFE.jpg)

Note:
was a fan of this other guy.

--

![](imgs/carl_gustav_jung.jpg )

Note:
… his archenemy, Carl Gustave Jung.

(he actually looks like my grand father)

Like most archenemies, they use to be friends. Jung was the favorite disciple. Freud name him his sucesor and put him in charge of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

--

![](imgs/Psychoanalitic_Congress.jpg)

Note:
They disagree on the origin of libido and in the scope of unconscious. Freud, father of this ideas, thought the libido was just sexual, and the unconscious made of personal memories.

Jung disagree that the libido was only a sexual. He also believed that deeper than the personal unconscious was a bast collective ocean of shared psychological content. Not just instincts but a whole set of psychological structures, he later call archetypes. They manifest in mythological themes, images, patterns visible along generations and around the world.

--

![](imgs/jungsmodelofself.jpg)

Note:
I was in love with this ideas, to the point that I did a post degree in Jung and the use of art as a way to pull content from this deep ocean. To amplify meaning thought the use of different expressive languages.

--

![](imgs/DSC01571.JPG)
![](imgs/IMG_7313.JPG)
![](imgs/00023.jpg)

Note:
Is funny because each different language have the ability to think and said things in different ways. 

--

![](imgs/movement.gif)
Note:
Movement for example, it fluctuates over time... was this ability to transform things.... you enter into an activity with an emotion and thought dance you can move it, transform it into something else....

--


![](imgs/00030.jpg)

Note:
Painting is more like a sedimental process... you bring something and you put it on paper... then you add more and more stuff... an image slowly appears over time.

--

![](imgs/openprocessing.png)

Note:
So I was there looking to all this hybrid artist using code as a language. 
I was intrigue  about what the uses of this as an expressive language. What could be said with technology that could be said in another way.

I send emails to all the artist could found. 
Only one reply

Jung have a interesting concept call **synchronicity**
On his work he notice that In his diaries, what later become the red book….

Note:
… he wrote a series of apocalyptic dreams he had. He was concern of his own mental health. But then he start hearing similar dreams by some of his patients.  He was conflicted with the fact that maybe he was some how influencing them.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-01.jpg)

Note:
When the first world war start was clear for him that actually everybody was have been feeling something coming... In the same way animals feels natural disasters before they happen... There was something in there air that was pict subconsciously by him and his patient..

Because this events didn't directly respond to a cause and effect relation. He call them acausal events. And he thought they could be explain because  of the collective incouncius

In June 2011  (five years ago)...
without any notice....
and after 50 years of lying dormant a volcano at the south of Chille call Puyehue made eruption.

Note:
the ashes bring destruction.
- all flights cancel across the southern half of the continent
- Nilahue River went up to 113° and killed around 4.5 million fishes
- heart attacks and got throat cancer on the livestock
- fluoride intoxication in sheep, cattle and horses
- bring five years of drought on Chubut and Rio Negro
This incredible force of nature brings a lot of destructions on it's way

Note:
During the volcano I was working on a project that use kinect camera to do a projection mapping of a ecosystem simulation over a sandbox. My goal was to invite user to interact with it, and by that bring destruction that will take some time to heal and go back to homeostasis. The scale of the volcano eruption had a great influence in this peace. I replace the sand by volcanic ashes, and work hard on it to make the algorithms as complex and realistic as I could. For that I had to learn shaders. It wasn't easy, but at the end was very satisfying to see that the people interacting with it. I like to think that something of what we experience that year could be re experienced in this particular way. In order to think it in a different and healing way.

Note:
There is something that give us pleasure of having the illusion of controlling chaos and chance. Even when we see that the repercussions of our interactions scape our perception of understanding... we find confort in the illusion of control.

Open Source it into an OF addon: ofFX

Note:
Shader is a coding language... a series of direction, but from the point of view of a single pixel.
I really like them because of their simplicity, power and restrictions.
They seems like a HAIKUs to me. 
There is no library to reference... just mathematical functions. So is very minimal.
And you do is generate images.
