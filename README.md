DEC 2009

Note:
In December 2009, I was working as **clinical psychologist and expressive art therapist** and starting the annoying process of **making your own website for my practice**.

I was **teaching my self** flash and googling around I search for this [“processing XML”] 

--

![](imgs/processingXML.png)

Note:
which leads me to **Processing** documentation

--

![](imgs/processing.png)

Note:
I was shocked and amazed!!  

People were doing art with code.
…I feel that I tap into a world of **misfits** like me.

Beside the fact that I always have been a nerd that like computers. Buenos Aires, is together with Paris and Upper West Side, is one of the last places on the world where people do (and like) Psychoanalyst.

So while everybody was into this guy:

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->

![](imgs/carl_gustav_jung.jpg ) <!-- {_class="fragment"} -->

Note:
was a super fan of this other guy.
… his archenemy. Carl Gustave Jung.

(he actually looks like my grand father)

Like most **archenemies**, they use to be friends. Jung was the favorite disciple. Freud name him his sucesor and put him in charge of the International Psychoanalytical Association.

--

![](imgs/Psychoanalitic_Congress.jpg)

Note:
They disagree on the origin of libido and in the scope of unconscious. Freud, father of this ideas, thought the libido was just sexual, and the unconscious made of personal memories.

Jung disagree that the libido was only a sexual. He also believed that deeper than the personal unconscious was a deep **collective ocean of shared psychological content**. Not just instincts but a whole set of psychological structures, he later call archetypes. They manifest in mythological themes, images, patterns visible along generations and around the world.

--

![](imgs/pcs201318f1.jpg)

Note:
For him the personal psique emerge from this collective sea.

Note:

Like islands over the sea.
[Note, this are not island… I’m just drowning Rio]

--

![](imgs/self.png)

Note:
This is the diagram of the psychic structure for Jung.
Note how for him deliberated looks like a mandala.

The term mandalas can be use loosely to any symbolic circular forms that speaks refers to "the hole". We can find them on all mayor religions.

Jung's theory open the doors to new was of using mythological and symbolic content to amplify emerging archetypes.

Lydia Clark

Note:
In the 70's groups like the one lider by the brazilean Lygia's Clark, saw this as an opportunity to use rituals to support non verbal expression, and sensorial stimulation and group dynamic.

Note:
With it, different expressive languages like music, dance...

--

![](imgs/DSC05498.jpg)

Note:
sculpture and painting serve as a non verbal medium that facilitate this practice.

--

![](imgs/a0431.jpg)

Note:
Each different language have the ability to think and said things in different ways. 

--

![](imgs/movement.gif)
Note:
Movement for example, it fluctuates over time... was this ability to transform things.... you enter into an activity with an emotion and thought dance you can move it, transform it into something else....

--

![](imgs/IMG_4796.jpg)

Note:
Painting is more like a sedimental process... you bring something and you put it on paper... then you add more and more stuff... 

--

![](imgs/IMG_4900.jpg)

Note:
Or sculpture is about subtracting, moving and releasing until a recognizable shape appears.

--

![](imgs/openprocessing.png)

Note:
So... back to processing. I was there looking to all this hybrid artist using code as a language. Seen for the first time code and computers as an expressive language.
What unique possibilities this language unlocks for us?

And I felt arriving to my own nerd heaven.
I send emails to all the artist could found. 
Only one reply

*Fundacion Telefonica* - **INTERACTIVOS** (2010)

Note:
Here we are in interactivos 2010. I made great friends there, like Tomas Rawski, Joaquin Aras and Javier .... 

I think it was particularly great because was unexpected. Everything was exciting and vibran. I was truly feeling that I was integrating more parts of my self.

Jung have a interesting concept call **synchronicity**.
Analyzing his on dreams (and then drawing them in what becomes the famous Red Book)

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-00.jpg)

Note:
… he wrote a series recurring apocalyptic dreams he was having. 
Those dreams scare him to the point that he was concern of his own mental health. 

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-03.jpg)

Note:
Then he start hearing similar dreams by some of his patients.
He was conflicted with the fact that maybe he was some how influencing them.

--

<!-- .slide: data-background="#000000" -->
![](imgs/redbook-01.jpg)

Note:
When the first world war start, it was clear for him that actually everybody was have been feeling something coming... 
In the same way animals feels natural disasters before they happen...  There was something in there air that was pict subconsciously by him and his patient..

Because this events didn't directly respond to a cause and effect relation. He call them a-causal events. And he thought they could be explain because of the collective unconscious

In June 2011  (five years ago)...
without any notice....

Note:
Before the volcano arrive, I was working on a project that consist projecting on top of sandbox a simulation of an ecosystem from the surface of the sandbox with kinect.

I was inviting the user to interact with it, and by doing that the user bring destruction. Then he have to wait, It takes time to the life on the simulation to go back to homeostasis. 

Although, we can't blame human kind directly for the eruption of the volcano, I use the ashes. For me was a symbol of how little we know. How much less power, and lack control we have. Specially at big scale.

Note:
Although Efecto Mariposa is made in openFrameworks, all the computation power comes from the GPU using shaders. A shader or two for each one of the sphere I was simulating. The process of learning shaders was hard, because of the lack of documentation about it. I decide to give something back to the OF community by breaking this shaders into modules of an addon, then with I called `ofFX`.

That addon becomes very popular...

I wonder how much of our decade is about recreating with data thehis Jungian conception of the collective unconscious. 

Every wiki project, every bid data, computer learning, AI thing... had this promise of making sense of a huge amount of chaotic content. Extracting small glimpse of what could be or happen.

What archetype is that one?

Note:
Mapzen was other teams beside the one I work on (the graphic one). We have a data team, a search engine and a routing engine. 

This engines are very expensive to develop. So companies makes them as an investment... which means close... they implementing over and over again... keeping the innovation close and lost. 

Thanks to the work coming from the search and routing teams, is the first time this engines are develop in the open, and regular people get to see them and study how they work. We feel that this will help by rising the ceilings on the industry. 

As I said is a privilege to work in mapzen, not just because I get to work with thoughtful and talented people like

Note:
In the spirit of it I start my own book for those that want to learn shaders... so they don't have to replicate the esoteric experience of teaching yourself shaders.

--

![](imgs/TBoS-00.png)

Note:
I call it The Book of Shaders... as a satiric reference to The Book of Shadows.
In it I start dealing with questions about. Where to start? What's the best way to learn or teach code? How a shader "hello world" example should look like? What are the minimum requirements terms of equipment, conceptual and technical?

--

![](imgs/TBoS-01.png)

Note:
So together with the writing and thinking metaphors to explain concept. I found my self developing tools around the book. An ecosystem of apps that allows student to live code... helps them understand by tweaking and changing. Also tools that help them store, share and show their work.

--

<iframe class='fit' width='100%' height='1000px' data-src='http://thebookofshaders.com/05'></iframe>

Note:
The live coding editor, was crucial. Let's people have a tangible experience of what they are doing.

Also the fact that can be embebed was very important. Reducing the distance between the reading of a concept and the trying of it in code. 

The helpers to tweak and change variables was very helpful to make abstract concept more tangible. For example a vec3 can be a color, a position or direction. This concept are interchable in the shader. Because shaders are basically mathematical functions. And vectors have this plasticity.

This openSource project also open new chances of working with others.

I just so thanks full to them.
They had translate the book of shaders to Japanise, Korean, Spanish and French. The italian translation is on the way.

Also talking to them is bringing new voices. I have this feeling that the project start having a life in it's own.

*by Ishac Bertran (@ishacbertran) & Jon Whol (@jonwohl)*

Note:
Ishac and Jon are using glslViewer. The first player I made on  C++ to live code shaders from any text editor. This program runs shaders in different platforms including the console of the RaspberryPi. They are using it to run artwork in glsl, that is pushed remotely from the web in this frames running a RaspberryPi. GlslViewer follow the same scheem of the embebed editor on the book. So it was easy to modify it to push content to openFrame.

Shaders is the language that I choose today.
And in this format helps me mostly because of the restrictions.

- RaspberryPi are slow and underpowered.
- Shaders have a minimal API which mostly consist on mathematical operations
- There are no libraries
- There is no other output than images.
